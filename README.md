# Survival-Prediction-in-Titanic-Disaster
In this project, I will go through the process of finding those factors that affect the survival rate prediction in the titanic disaster. I've to use the famous titanic dataset that available on 
Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data].

## Onjectives:
1) Which features could contribute the higher survival rate?
2) What is the correlation between Age, Sex, Embarked and Pclass with survival?
3) Which algorithm get the higher accuracy?


## Dependencies:

- sklearn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

For avoiding operating system warnings, have to import the 'os' library.
* pip install os (download)
* import os (importing)

## Guidelines :

1) Import the Libraries
2) Load the data
3) Data Wrangling to find instghts of data
4) Perform Data Pre-processing to handle missing values and categorical values 
5) Algorithm implemetation
6) Algorithm Optimization
7) Hypertuning increase the accuracy of algorithm

## Conclusion:
I've to write the blog post to understand the features survival rate and correlation between them. You may find it on medium.
